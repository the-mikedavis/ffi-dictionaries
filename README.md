# FFI dictionaries

This crate exposes Rust bindings for [Hunspell](https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell) and [Nuspell](https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell). This crate is not meant to be depended on: this is meant for debugging the values Hunspell and Nuspell return and for benchmarking purposes. If you're looking for Rust bindings for these projects you can use this crate as a reference instead.
